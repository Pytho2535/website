## CompTIA Security+
CompTIA Security+ is a beginner-level certification. It teaches you the basics of cybersecurity and is mostly theory, which is why I don’t like it very much. If you want to study for it, I recommend Professor Messer on YouTube, his notes and practice exams are very helpful. Most importantly, I recommend downloading the official exam objectives and studying them from top to bottom, making sure you can explain every single topic you find there. It helped me a lot, and it’s free. It took me about 1.5 months to pass it, so it’s not that bad. Good luck passing it!
